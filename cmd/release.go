in the repo manifest.  Else, it will look in your charts directory to
generate the chart with.`,

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// repoCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// repoCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
